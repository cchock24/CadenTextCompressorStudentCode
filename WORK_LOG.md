| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                    I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Dec 3   | 11:10-11:50 |      Thought about the problem set, Starting looking into what words/letters I can give special bit codes for |
| Dec 4   | 11:00-12:00 | Added a couple more bit codes. Decided to change the binary numbers into normal ones to make easier. Thinking |
| Dec 5   | 12:00-1:00  |                        Turned the Letters into an array to make things easier, working on expand and compress |
| Dec 10  | 12:45-1:45  |               Work and finished Compress haven't tested it out yet, but we'll see. Starting to work on Expand |
| Dec 11  | 12:00-1:00  |                                                                      Finished Expand now I just need to debug |
